<h2>L.A.B Report</h2>
<h4>from the notebooks of angella yu</h4>
<p>Hey guys,</p>
<p>Every month, I sit down and write a hand crafted letter to my students. It usually contains the latest things I've learnt or discovered. The goal is to keep you inspired and motivated on your journey to becoming a developer.</p>
<p>I sometimes talk about my struggles as a programmer. I often talk about side projects I'm working on. Most of my friends work in tech, so often I also capture some of my conversations with VCs, founders, CEOs on things like tech stack trends, insider tips and life hacks,</p>
<p>In addition, the tech world moves very fast and it's difficult to keep on top of all the new developments, tools and skills. So in every edition of the L.A.B. Report, you'll discover 3 things I read in that month. I read a lot, and I try to pick out the top three things I discovered on topics such as Design, Programming, Productivity, Startup Growth and more</p>
<p>You can see a sample <a href="https://www.appbrewery.com/p/newsletter/">here</a> and decide whether if this is something you would want to receive once a month. </p>
<p>So I hope that in June, you'll be brave and go after what you want. Don't chase praise. Don't believe people who want to pay you with prestige. Don't overthink and just put in the work to become the version of you that you like the most</p>
<P>Let me know on Twitter <a href="https://x.com/yu_angela">@sahilyu</a> your thoughts and stories</P>
